# Original ARM64 runtime recovery — 21 October 2026

The original `libaaa.so` now loads and executes through the exact firmware's Android 9 / API 28 Bionic linker under QEMU AArch64. All transitive ELF dependencies were recovered from the full, hash-matched X2D II 100C 1.3.16.2 firmware. No dependency stubs, patched vendor functions, or transplanted phone calibration were used.

## Fresh results

- Earlier five-job Android replay: **5/5 PASS**, including 9 direct original leaf calls and 10,000 original-versus-portable calls.
- Extended same-process leaf comparison: **27,588 original calls, zero failures**.
- Extended cases: 6,561 boundary combinations, 20,000 deterministic random vectors, 1,024 pointer-alias cases, and 3 null-pointer / zero-divisor cases.
- Across those cases: 3,049 zero-divisor returns; 11,753 cases with an overflowing initial 32-bit shift; 12,304 comparisons also matched the unchanged guarded portable implementation in its supported domain. These are overlapping counters, not additional original calls.
- Status 89 returns before touching gain memory when either divisor is zero. Valid calculations truncate the 32-bit shift before unsigned division. Aliased gains receive sequential updates.
- The original first loadable segment starts at virtual address `0x1000`. Bionic's `dladdr().dli_fbase` is the mapped start, so subtracting it alone from a symbol is not its ELF virtual address. The harness accounts for this.
- The complete newly extracted firmware manifest exactly matches the previously preserved manifest, including both system and vendor image hashes.

The two reports contain freshly executed results, not copied historical pass counts. Together these suites made **37,597 original gain-leaf calls**.

## Reproduce

```sh
python3 hasselblad_native_audit/awb_original_runtime_20261021/run_recalib.py \
  --firmware-root /private/extracted \
  --ndk /tools/android-ndk-r27 \
  --qemu /tools/qemu-aarch64-static \
  --output /private/new-results
```

Python requires `pyelftools`. The runner verifies the library, original symbol, Android version, linker, and full DT_NEEDED closure against the saved extraction manifest before compiling and executing. It records exact source/binary hashes and build/run commands. Runtime inputs are private external files; this directory contains only owned code and public-safe reports.

`hb_recalib_exact` is a research comparator, with original wraparound and pointer-alias semantics. It does not replace the production adapter's input guards. The unchanged inherited portable source is read from Rebuild04 because the GitHub Rebuild05 directory contains incremental files, whereas the private Rebuild05 ZIP contains a complete source tree.

## Remaining acceptance boundaries

This checkpoint restores original code execution and verifies the recalibration leaf. It does **not** establish original AWB initialization, scene-optimizer equivalence, authentic E2 frame preparation, seven-frame context/REAWB parity, full AWB, HNCS rendering, or phone validation. Next: restore calibrated original initialization, then the optimizer at `0x4a8c48` with justified state and caller-side count updates.

No APK was built. `main` and the installed Native1C application remain unchanged.
